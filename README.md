# PyPass

PyPass is a simple password manager written in Python. It uses the [Fernet](https://cryptography.io/en/latest/fernet.html) symmetric encryption scheme to encrypt and decrypt passwords. The passwords are stored in a SQLite database.

The user account recovery mechanism is functional, however, it is not connected to an smtp server.
