## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you encounter an issue with the application, please open an issue on the GitHub repository. Or, if you are able to fix the issue, please open a pull request.

I will try to respond to issues as quickly as possible, but please be patient as I am a full-time student and may not be able to respond immediately.
